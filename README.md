# password-generator

## Description

This is a random password generator where you're able to click a generate button and go through the prompts to create the password. Some of the prompts ask whether you want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters in your password. I used JavaScript to make this possible, some syntaxes used for this were for loops, Math.random, Math.floor, if statements, etc.
